# Controlled-rectangle

This code creates a window with a size of 700x500 pixels, sets the title of the window to "Controlled Rectangle", and sets the background color to white. It also creates a player represented by a black rectangle that can be moved using the arrow keys. The game loop continuously updates the player's position based on the keys pressed, clears the screen, and redraws the player at its new position. The game will exit when the player closes the window.
